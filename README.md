# pinball_NEAT
NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies(NEAT) is a Genetic Algorithm for generation of evolving artificial neural networks. 

This algorithm has shown a great promise in complex Reinforcement Learning Tasks. So I implemented this algorithm in the 'VideoPinball-v0' environment in OpenAI Gym. 

Initial stages of training:

NEAT alters both the weighting parameters and the structures of networks. It ultimately finds a balance between the fitness of the evolved solutions and their diversity.
